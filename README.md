# Developer Digital Twin (MVP Demo)

A demonstration of **Agent-Responsive Design** principles through an interactive web application. This project showcases how digital interfaces can be designed to be "bilingual" - speaking clearly to both humans and AI agents.

## üåü Key Concepts

- **Semantic Front Door**: UIs visually appealing to humans but semantically clear to machines
- **AI-First Back Door**: APIs returning structured, actionable responses enabling agent self-correction
- **Dual-Audience Architecture**: Interface elements serving both human usability and machine readability

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-responsive-digital-twin.git
   cd agent-responsive-digital-twin
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create `.env.local` in `packages/frontend` with:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
     NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
     ```
   - Create `.env` in `packages/backend` with:
     ```
     PORT=3001
     CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
     ```

### Development

Run both frontend and backend in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run them individually:
```bash
npm run dev:frontend
npm run dev:backend
```

### Production Build

Build both packages:
```bash
npm run build
```

Start in production mode:
```bash
npm run start
```

## üìê Project Architecture

The project follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Tier** (Next.js Frontend)
   - React components with semantic markup
   - Tailwind CSS styling
   - Developer command interface

2. **Orchestration Tier** (Next.js API Routes)
   - Claude AI integration
   - Response streaming
   - Context management

3. **Services Tier** (Express.js Backend)
   - API simulator with dual response modes
   - Traditional vs AI-first response patterns

## üß© Core Features

- **Developer Command Interface**: Interactive AI agent command center
- **Semantic Layer Demo**: Comparison of agent-friendly vs agent-hostile UI patterns
- **API Evolution Demo**: Traditional vs AI-first API response patterns
- **API Simulator**: Backend providing realistic examples of both API response paradigms

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API
- **Deployment**: Vercel
